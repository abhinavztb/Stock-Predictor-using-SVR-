Support Vector Machine‚Äù (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or regression challenges. However,  it is mostly used in classification problems. In this algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is number of features you have) with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. Then, we perform classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiate the two classes very well

We define support vectors as the farthest points of two different kinds of data and these support vectors when identified then the other train data can be ignored and a decision boundary is drawn between them to classify data into two parts .
The above explained is for LINEAR SVM
For non linear data we can use NON LINEAR SVM but it's computational time is quite high so we use kernel function which helps us reduce the time complexity of the algorithm.
Popular used kernel's are :
Polynomial Kernel : (x*y+1)^d
Radial Basis Function :
